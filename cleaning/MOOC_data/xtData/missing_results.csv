"""Pay Attention!!"" ADHD Through the Lifespan",Coursera,Disease & Disorders,NA,University of Pennsylvania,0,0,English,NA,3,2013-03-25,NA,NA,NA,"It is estimated that 5-8% of school-aged children and 4% of adults in the United States suffer from some form of attention deficit disorder and that the incidence of the disorder is increasing in the population. Although it is the most widely studied behavior disorder of childhood, its etiology remains unclear, its outcome is variable, and its treatment is complex and moderately successful. Advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the pathophysiology of ADHD, pointing to key neural circuits involved in attention, behavioral control, learning, and reward maintenance that appear to be underperforming in patients with the disorder. Moreover, the etiology of this heterogeneous disorder points to the key role of genetic and?environmental interactions during prenatal and perinatal periods. Over the past decade, new diagnostic and interventional approaches have enabled clinicians to better diagnose and treat ADHD across the lifespan, while longitudinal studies have elucidated the long-term impact of the disorder on health and adaptive functioning. This course is intended for students with a background in psychology and/or neuroscience who are interested in learning more about the complexities of ADHD from both scientific and clinical perspectives. Scientific topics covered include prevalence and epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, clinical presentation at different ages, impact on development (intellect, academic, speech and language, emotional self control, motivation and executive functioning), health outcomes (risk taking, accidents, injuries, driving difficulties, unintended pregnancy), co-existing conditions (anxiety, mood, substance use disorders), and etiology (genetic, pre/perinatal, neurodevelopmental, neuroanatomic, neuropsychological).

Rationing and Allocating Scarce Medical Resources,Coursera,Philosophy,NA,University of Pennsylvania,4,1,English,NA,9,2013-05-27,NA,NA,NA,"You have one liver but three patients awaiting a liver transplant. Who should get the liver? What criteria should be used to select the recipient? Is it fair to give it to an alcoholic? These are some of the questions that arise in the context of rationing and allocating scarce health care resources among particular individuals, and concern what are called micro-allocation decisions. But trade-offs also need to be made at the meso- and macro-level. Budgets of public payers of healthcare, such as governments, and of private ones, such as health plans, are limited: they cannot cover all drugs and services that appear beneficial to patients or physicians. So what services should they provide? Is there a core set of benefits that everyone should be entitled to? How can we make fair decisions, if we know from the outset than not all needs can be met? Using the cases of organs for transplantation, the rationing for vaccines in a flu pandemic, and drug shortages, the course will critically examine alternative theories for allocating scarce resources among individuals, while also exploring the principles and values that underlie those theories. Syllabus Logistics and Grading This class is seven weeks long. Each week, students will watch approximate 30 - 40 minutes of lectures by Dr. Emanuel. Students should expect to spend 2 - 5 hours per week reading related materials from the reading list, all of which are freely accessible online. Students taking the course for a grade will complete one quiz (also referred to throughout the course as a peer assessment) per week, which will be peer-graded based on a detailed answer key provided after the due date. Of the seven scores earned for assignments, the lowest two scores will be dropped in calculating the final grade. The remaining five scores will be weighted equally. As a result, students who miss a homework assignment can still earn full credit in the course. There are no exams or final projects in this course. Students not taking the course for a grade may choose not to complete the assignments. The details of these logistics are subject to change; if changes are made, students will be notified via an announcement and this page will be updated. Course Outline Week 1: ""Who Gets the Liver?"" & History of Rationing We begin the course with a hypothetical case. We have one liver and three patients who will die if they don't get a transplant. We will discuss some of the potential approaches for making life and death decisions in the context of absolute scarcity. Next we will explore the history of rationing in medicine. Absolute scarcity has always been a problem. How have we dealt with this problem in the past? We'll take a look at what happened in the cases of three major 20th century medial advances: insulin, penicillin, and dialysis. Week 2: Conceptual Distinctions The study of rationing was borne out of the concept of absolute scarcity in medicine--cases in which the demand for medical care far exceeds the resources existing to meet that need. Because demand will inevitably exceed supply--no matter what--choices must be made about which patients receive treatment, and which don't. But what do we really mean when we use the term 'rationing?' Is there a difference between the terms rationing, resource allocation, and priority-setting? In this lecture, we will attempt to explain the conceptual distinctions that give meaning to the terms we use in this course. Week 3: Organs for Transplantation Kidneys, livers, hearts, and lungs are among the most discussed absolutely scarce medical resources. And their allocation poses some of the most vexing ethical dilemmas. The lecture for this week will break down the process by which organs for transplantation are allocated in the United States through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We will discuss some of the values and principles that are implicitly favored in the UNOS rules and grapple with a few particularly difficult cases. Should alcoholics with cirrhosis be eligible to receive a liver transplant, if their receiving a liver means a person with a ""blameless"" liver disease will die as a result? What role should socioeconomic or legal status play in organ transplantation? Do you agree with the UNOS policies as written? Week 4: Theories This week, we will explore some of the moral schools of thought that have shaped the modern-day study of bioethics, and have a tremendous impact on health policy. Deontology regards morality as the driving guide behind our choices of what we ought to do. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, views the proper course of action as the one that maximizes utility. The tension between these two ethical theories highlights the ethical dilemmas that bioethicists face in determining how to ration scarce medical resources. Week 5: Values & Principles Value judgments are inescapable in rationing decisions. But what are the competing values and principles that are inherently at play? How can one choose among them? This week's lecture explores 4 key values and 8 guiding principles that ethicists and policymakers must consider when confronting rationing decisions. We'll look at the distinctions between the values and principles, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. Additionally, we'll examine the Complete Lives System, which is a theoretical framework designed to draw upon multiple principles and values. Week 6: Flu Emergency This week, we will explore another real life example of rationing in action. What should we do if there is a major flu pandemic and there isn't enough vaccine to go around? Who should get the limited vaccine and who should not? We'll examine the U.S. Government's actual policy for major health crises. For example, we will look at Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) briefs that deal with allocation protocols in the event of an influenza pandemic. We will also look into historical examples of flu crises, and analyze the ethical approaches taken in specific case studies. Week 7: From Micro to Macro For the final week of the course, we'll examine the difference between micro rationing decisions and meso/macro decisions. We'll look at the case of Shep Glazer, whose testimony before Congress fundamentally changed the way dialysis treatment was allocated in the United States. We'll also look briefly at cost effectiveness analysis and the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) as tools for macro level decisions. What paradoxes arise when using these tools? Do they favor some people over others? What values are implicit in policies that draw upon cost-effectiveness and QALYs?",/enroll?course_id=55,55

Social Epidemiology,Coursera,Public Health,NA,University of Minnesota,4,1,English,NA,3,2013-06-10,NA,NA,NA,"This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad perspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such as familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces -- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing evidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant to the topic. The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental causes of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups. For example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people differently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is a narrowly defined medical problem. Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials, and complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability to synthesize ideas. Upon completion of the course students should: have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health of populations, be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature that address the causes of disease, be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status, and? be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical for policy making.

The Law of the European Union: An Introduction,Coursera,Law,NA,Leiden University,5,1,English,NA,6.5,2013-06-14,NA,NA,NA,"In 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for its decades-long contribution to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe. War has become virtually unthinkable in the EU. When the first steps towards supranational cooperation - primarily targeted at preventing the rearmament of Germany - were made in the aftermath of World War Two, the Founding Fathers of the European integration construct could never have imagined this outcome in their wildest dreams. Over the years, the supranational cooperation would widen - from the original European Communities consisting of 6 Member States to the current Union of 27 Members ? and deepen ? from the originally almost purely economically inspired Communities to the current Union with a say in almost all areas of national competence. At the same time, problems with the Euro have plunged the EU in one of the biggest crises since its inception. This challenges lawmakers to tackle difficult questions about the continued existence of the Euro and the future direction of the European integration project. This course will give the students an insight into the law of the EU, a vast and fascinating area of law which forms an integral part of the legal systems of its 27 Member States. The course is divided into three parts. In the first part, we will pay attention to the creation and the development of the EU, its institutional structure and functioning, and the specific nature and sources of EU law. In the second part, we will examine how EU law impacts on the lives of EU citizens as well as on companies that are established or provide services in the EU. In the final part, we will tackle Europe¡¯s common currency crisis, investigating causes, effects and possible routes out of this existential crisis of the Union. If you are a student, lawyer, entrepreneur or simply interested in the EU, its?development and legal system, this course will provide you with the foundations.?The course is of interest to people both inside and outside the European Union: EU citizens may learn how to benefit from the rights contained in EU life; people from other parts of the world may learn from the EU¡¯s specific set-up, its functioning and the legal solutions being applied in the European context.",/enroll?course_id=244,244

This growth over the past decade is partly attributable to the growth of neuroscience itself and to the challenging philosophical and moral questions it inherently raises. A 2012 Royal Society report observes that ¡°(a)n increasingly mechanistic understanding of the brain raises a host of ethical, legal, and social implications. This has laid the foundation for the emergent field of Neuroethics, which examines ethical issues governing the conceptual and practical developments of neuroscience. Irrespective of their validity, even the claims that modern neuroscience entails the re-examination of complex and sensitive topics like free will, consciousness, identity, and responsibility raises significant ethical issues. As such, neuroethics asks questions that extend beyond the usual umbrella of biomedical ethics.¡± This course will, therefore, consider the new knowledge and ways of learning about the brain from scientific and ethico-legal and social standpoints.

This course focuses on Emotional Support because it is really the foundation of every early childhood classroom. In classrooms that are Emotionally Supportive children and adults are comfortable with one another and excited about learning. They look forward to spending time together and know that, even when times are tough, there will be someone there to help them. What do you need to know to be a really effective early childhood teacher?

In this course we¡¯ll focus a bit on knowledge about children¡¯s development and we¡¯ll spend lots of time focused on knowledge about specific types of classroom interactions that promote learning and development. Another part of effective teaching is seeing. All the knowledge in the world about effective teaching is only a piece of the puzzle. Good teachers need to see what effective teaching looks like ? in lots of different types of classrooms, with lots of different types of children. Teachers tell us they don¡¯t get nearly enough opportunities to see other teachers teach and they report how helpful these experiences are when they do get them. We¡¯ll spend lots of time in this course focused on observing classroom videos and we¡¯ll also ask you to spend some time watching yourself teach. Ultimately we can¡¯t learn to be an effective teacher without practice ? we need to spend some time doing ? enacting the teaching practices that we¡¯ll learn about. Just as young children need to do things to really learn about them ? you need to spend some time practicing the types of interactions we¡¯ll be talking about. There¡¯s one last important element to being an effective teacher. Effective? teachers spend time reflecting on their practice. We think of this a bit like taking time to really look at your teaching through a magnifying glass ? we¡¯ll give you time to reflect on your teaching and what you have learned throughout this course. Much of this course is based on the research of Drs. Robert Pianta, Bridget Hamre and many colleagues UVA and other institutions using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System ? or CLASS(¢â). CLASS is an observational measure used in research and practice that defines specific elements of effective teaching. In this course you will see examples of the kinds of teaching practices assessed by the CLASS.

Discrete Inference and Learning in Artificial Vision,Coursera,Artificial Intelligence,NA,?cole Centrale Paris,2.5,2,English,NA,2.5,2013-05-12,NA,NA,NA,"Artificial vision applications, such as object detection in natural images and automatic segmentation of medical acquisitions, rely on models that interpret the visual information provided to a computer. The model provides a compromise between the support given by the observations and the prior domain knowledge. This course is concerned with the two computational problems that arise when using such models in practice. Inference (Energy Minimization): Given a visual observation (for example, an image or an MRI scan), we are interested in estimating its most likely interpretation (i.e. the location of all the objects in the image, or the segments of the MRI scan) according to the model. While the problem cannot be solved optimally, we will describe state of the art approximate algorithms that provide very accurate solutions in practice. While the theoretical properties of the algorithms will be discussed briefly, the main emphasis will be on their application. ?Learning (Parameter Estimation): Given a set of training samples consisting of inputs and their desired outputs, (for example, images and the location of the objects, or MRI scans and their segmentations) we would like to estimate a model that is suited to the task at hand. We will show how the problem of learning a model can be formulated as empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, we will present efficient algorithms for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Syllabus Lecture 1: Introduction to artificial vision with discrete graphical models: In this lecture, the interdisciplinary nature of computational vision is briefly introduced along with its potential use in different application domains. Subsequently, the concept of discrete modeling of artificial vision tasks is introduced from theoretical view point along with short examples demonstrating the interest of such an approach in low, mid and high-level vision. Examples refer to blind image deconvolution, knowledge-based image segmentation, optical flow, graph matching, 2d-to-3d view-point invariant detection and modeling and grammar-driven image based reconstruction. Lecture 2: Reparameterization and dynamic programming: In this lecture, we provide a brief introduction to undirected graphical models. We also provide a formal definition of the problem of inference (specifically, energy minimization). We introduce the concept of reparameterization, which forms the building block of all the inference algorithms discussed in the course. We describe a simple inference algorithm known as dynamic programming, which consists of a series of reparameterization. We show how dynamic programming can be used to perform exact inference on chains. Lecture 3: Maximum flow and minimum cut:? In this lecture, we introduce the concept of functions on arcs of a directed graph. We focus on a special function known as the flow function. Associated with this function is the combinatorial optimization problem of computing the maximum flow of a directed graph. We also introduce the concept of a cut in a directed graph, and prove that the minimum cost cut is equivalent to the maximum flow. We describe a simple algorithm for solving the maximum flow, or equivalent the minimum cut, problem. Lecture 4: Minimum cut based inference: In this lecture, we show how the problem of inference for undirected graphical models with two labels can be formulated as a minimum cut problem. We characterize the energy function that can be minimized optimally using the minimum cut problem. We show examples using the image segmentation and texture synthesis problems, which can be formulated using two labels. We consider the multi-label problem, and devise approximate algorithms for inference based on the minimum cut algorithms. We show examples using the stereo reconstruction and the image denoising problems. Lecture 5: Belief propagation: In this lecture we present the basic concepts of message passing and belief propagation networks. The concept is initially demonstrated using chains, extended to the case of trees and then eventually to arbitrary graphs. The strengths and the limitations of such an optimization framework are presented. The image completion and texture synthesis problems are considered as examples to demonstrate the interest of such a family of optimization algorithms. Lecture 6: Linear programing and duality:? In this lecture, discrete inference is addressed through concepts coming from linear programming relaxations. In particular, we explain how a graph-optimization problem can be expressed as a linear programing one and then how one can take benefit of the duality theorem to develop efficient optimization methods. The problem of optical flow and its deformable registration variant in medical image analysis is considered as an example to demonstrate the interest of such optimization algorithms. Lecture 7: Dual decomposition and higher order graphs: In this lecture, we introduce the dual decomposition framework for the optimization of low rank and higher order graphical models. First, we demonstrate the concept of the method using a simple toy example and then we extend to the most general optimization problem case. Three different examples are considered in the context of higher order optimization, the problem of linear mapping between images, the case of dense deformable graph matching and the development of pose invariant object segmentation methods in the context of medical imaging. Lecture 8: Parameter learning: In this lecture, we introduce two frameworks for estimating the parameters of a graphical model using fully supervised training data. The first framework maximizes the likelihood of the training data while regularizing the parameters. The second framework minimizes the empirical risk, as measured by a user-defined loss function, while regularizing the parameters. We provide a brief description of the algorithms required to solve the related optimization problems. We show the results obtained on standard machine learning datasets.",/enroll?course_id=12697,12697
Computational Molecular Evolution,Coursera,Biology,NA,Technical University of Denmark (DTU),4.25,4,English,NA,8,2013-01-28,6,NA,NA,"This course is about molecular evolution - the evolution of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules. The focus is on computational methods for inferring phylogenetic trees from sequence data, and the course will give an introduction to the fundamental theory and algorithms, while also giving the student hands-on experience with some widely used software tools. Since evolutionary theory is the conceptual foundation of biology (in the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky: ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution""), what you learn on this course will be relevant for any project you will ever do inside the life sciences. A phylogenetic tree will almost always help you think more clearly about your biological problem.? A special emphasis is put on methods that employ explicit models of the evolutionary process (maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches), and we will explore the role of statistical modeling in molecular evolution, and in science more generally. A mathematical (statistical) model of a biological system can be considered to be a stringently phrased hypothesis about that system, and this way of thinking about models will often be helpful. In addition to model-based methods, you will also learn about other approaches, such as those based on parsimony and genetic distance (e.g., neighbor joining).? Often, the evolutionary tree is the result we are interested in - knowing how a set of sequences (or organisms) are related can provide us with important information about the biological problem we are ?investigating. For instance, knowing which organisms are most closely related to a newly identified, uncharacterized, pathogenic bacterium will allow you to infer many aspects of its lifestyle, thereby giving you important clues about how to fight it. In other cases, however, inferring the structure of the tree is not the goal: for instance, our main focus may instead be the detection of positions in a protein undergoing positive selection (indicating adaptation) or negative selection (indicating conserved functional importance). However, even in these cases, the underlying phylogenetic tree will be an important part of our hypothesis about (model of) how the proteins have been evolving, and will help in getting the correct answer.? Although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding, this course has been designed to be accessible also for students with limited computational background (e.g., students of biology). Topics covered: Brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics. Mechanisms of molecular evolution. Models of substitution. Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using parsimony, distance based methods, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques. Advanced models of nucleotide substitution (gamma-distributed mutation rates, codon models and analysis of selective pressure).

Introduction to Psychology as a Science,Coursera,Psychology,NA,Georgia Institute of Technology,5,1,English,NA,9,2013-10-07,NA,NA,NA,"Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict, and to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers, and later our friends and companions. This course shows, however, how the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific validation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology has learned how people behave and think. Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include discussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception, learning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion and motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and psychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short lecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments. Syllabus This is a twelve-week Introductory Psychology course that is usually taught in the first year of college. There is a Spring Break during the week of March 17-21, 2014. Psychology is a broad discipline as you can see in the outline, and the course will survey the many areas studied by psychologists. Psychologists study the mind and behavior. This course was funded by a generous grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The QM certification mark recognizes that this course met Quality Matters review standards. Prerequisite Knowledge There are no prerequisites for this course. Online Resources We will be using material developed by Carnegie Mellon University called the Open Learning Initiative.

Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti to Bramante,Coursera,Visual Arts,NA,Sapienza University of Rome,3.5,2,English,NA,3,2014-01-20,10,NA,NA,"Early Renaissance Architecture in Italy: from Alberti to Bramante When Leon Battista Alberti completed his treatise about architecture around 1452, his initial study of texts and monuments of Antiquity was based on mathematics and geometry as a reflection of nature, with a belief that architecture was a part of a man's civil duty. This attitude would condition the architectural principles of the early Renaissance and architects did not apply themselves to textual imitations of individual antique monuments. In Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational ¡°system¡± of Brunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with it in a return to tradition, like Michelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance was increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed immediate questions of decorative language? (antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of conceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic structural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first, the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system, and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural conceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms and models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first affirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome. Through some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces, technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista Alberti¡¯s to Francesco di Giorgio¡¯s and Bramante¡¯s proposals.

This course is designed for anyone concerned with the best ways of learning and thriving in the world we live in now.? It's for students, teachers, professors, researchers, administrators, policy makers, business leaders, job counselors and recruiters, parents, and lifelong learners around the globe. ?The full,? whimsical name of the class is: ¡°The History and Future of (Mostly) Higher Education: Or, How We Can Unlearn Our Old Patterns and Relearn for a Happier, More Productive, Ethical, and Socially-Engaged Future.¡± ?That subtitle is inspired by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen who has said that ""all education is vocational"" in the sense that it is our job, as educators, to help train people for the vocation of leading better lives.? Are we fulfilling that educational objective, from kindergarten to professional school? ?Or are we training students with the methods, philosophy, and metrics designed for the Fordist era of the Model T?? Since 1993, when scientists made the Internet widely available, our lives, our work, our occupations, our culture, and our entertainments have changed tremendously.? Far too little has changed inside our educational institutions, in the US and internationally, to prepare us for the demands, problems, restrictions, obstacles,? responsibilities, and possibilities of living in the world we inhabit outside of school.? This course addresses one key question:? How can we all, together, work to redesign higher education for our future... not for someone else¡¯s past? Bonus:?Students enrolled in this Coursera course will also be invited to many onsite and online events, workshops, and conferences offered by more than fifty learning institutions around the world, as part of an initiative on Shaping the Future of Higher Education. Syllabus Learning Objectives Understand how and why we inherited the Industrial Age educational systems. Think deeply about the requirements of the world we live in now. Discover new ideas, methods, competencies, and subject matter. Share our pathways to successful innovation with others around the world. Together, we can change schools, classrooms, institutions, learning--and maybe ourselves! ? WEEK ONE - January 27, 2014 Guiding Principles and Driving Concepts - Let¡¯s Get Started This week we will think about the uses of history: learning how and why educational institutions were constructed in the past helps us think about what we need now, in order to begin to shape a different future of education in order to help shape a more just future for all. WEEK TWO - February 3, 2014 The iPod Experiment: Or, Learning vs. Education Duke University¡¯s iPod experiment became international news. ?Why? ?What happens when students are in charge? ?What happens when education begins at a place where no one (not even the instructor) knows the answer in advance? What if the actual learning cannot be tested or assessed by the usual methods of higher education? What if learning is also about trying to improve the status quo?? This week we will look at diverse histories and theories of education and learning. WEEK THREE - February 10, 2014 Teaching Like It¡¯s 1992 ??? The World changed on April 22, 1993, when the scientists at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications released the Internet and the World Wide Web to the general public. ?From then on, anyone with access to an Internet connection could communicate? to anyone else with an Internet connection. ?No editor or publisher provides a safety net now and, at the same time, our data can be hacked, our privacy invaded.? The digital world we live in now comes with tremendous responsibilities and opportunity--and yet it comes with real inequalities, perils, and obstacles too. ?Does our educational system prepare us for these challenges? WEEK FOUR - February 17, 2014 Welcome to the Future: 10 Ways to Change the Paradigm of Higher Education We will now be looking at different principles, methods and metrics for redesigning an innovative form of learning that helps us all navigate the complexities of the world we inhabit outside of school. ?This week we focus specifically on innovations to the curriculum. WEEK FIVE - February 24, 2014 Innovations in Pedagogy (Methods) and Assessment This week we will focus on innovations in pedagogy (the methods for learning) and assessment. ?How you teach is what you teach.? And, we need to think deeply about what we value and make sure what we value is what we count.?? ? WEEK SIX - March 3, 2014 How to Make Institutional Change? Even if we make changes in our personal learning and teaching methods, we still have to work mostly within institutions of learning.? Institutional change can be difficult; it takes patience, strategy, and allies. This week offers (and also invites) ideas about what we can do together. It makes a powerful argument that we all need to advocate (in any country) for higher education and shows how, in the U.S., the decline in support for public education has contributed to income inequality and hurt all our future.? This week includes interviews with inspiring people who have worked together to make successful change happen in society ad in education, against odds. ?

Marine Megafauna: An Introduction to Marine Science and Conservation,Coursera,Environmental Science,NA,Duke University,5,4,English,NA,7,2014-02-10,NA,NA,NA,"This course is about?sea turtles,?whales, dolphins, seals, penguins, sharks, giant squid and other large ocean creatures - collectively known as marine megafauna - and what they can tell us about how the ocean works and why it is so important for all life on earth. This course will help you learn about life in the ocean, how ocean ecosystems function, how scientists study the ocean, and the challenges we face in sustaining healthy oceans for the future. These topics will be explored using case studies that focus on charismatic marine megafauna species ? the most compelling creatures in the ocean that capture our attention and inspire us to learn more. The course starts with an examination of the physical dimensions of the world¡¯s ocean and how we describe ocean zones based on the ecosystems found within them. Once these basics are covered, we will work through the evolution of life in the oceans and explore how marine animals have adapted to the challenges of a cold, dark and deep ocean. Throughout the class we will highlight how scientists study the oceans and the animals that live in them, providing glimpses of new technologies that boost our understanding of marine ecology. The course will also cover some of the challenges the oceans face due to human activities - exploring issues such as bycatch and climate change - and how they are affecting ocean species and systems. Throughout the course we will connect with real marine science through the use of open access scientific articles published in the journal PLOS ONE. This means you will have to learn how to read scientific papers and extract the important bits of information from them. The articles you¡¯ll be reading are all part of a new PLOS Collection focused on using open access research to teach marine science and conservation.

Citizenship and U.S. Immigration,Coursera,Law,NA,Emory University,5,1,English,NA,3.5,2014-02-17,NA,NA,NA,"This course analyzes the historical origins of citizenship and immigration in the United States and provides an overview of modern U.S. law.? Beyond traditional notions of ¡°law,¡± the course also includes significant elements of immigration policy, social science, history, political theory, and ethics. ?One goal of the course is to provide a basic knowledge base for students to make and influence law and policy in immigration and citizenship. Among the questions the course will explore: How is U.S. citizenship acquired?? Can it be lost? What is the origin and significance of the U.S. practice of awarding citizenship to anyone born here? Who decides who can enter the country, and who must leave? What rights do non-citizens have?? What about those who have entered the country illegally? What is most needed for immigration reform in the US? Syllabus Week 1: Citizenship Citizenship is the most basic distinction among persons currently living in or seeking to enter the United States, and thus we begin the course with this legal status. Topics covered this week include how one becomes a U.S. citizen, how citizenship at birth is determined in this and other countries, the concept of ""dual citizenship,"" and how citizenship might be lost. What rights come with citizenship? What are the reasons for becoming a U.S. citizen if a non-citizen is a lawful permanent resident? From Non-Citizen to Citizen: The Naturalization Process Citizenship at Birth: Jus Soli and Jus Sanguinis The Fourteenth Amendment's Birthright Citizenship Clause Status of Persons Born in U.S. Territories and Possessions Rights and Responsibilities of U.S. Citizens Proof of Citizenship; Dual Nationality; Loss of Citizenship U.S. Citizenship for Sale? (optional lecture) Week 2: History of U.S. Immigration Having considered the legal distinction between citizens and non-citizens in week one, we now turn to immigration into the United States, the first step toward attaining citizenship. Laws governing who may enter the country, the conditions of entry, and actions that may result in deportation will occupy the remainder of the course. This week we examine the history of U.S. immigration. Beginning with the Chinese Exclusion Acts in the 1880's, U.S. law has at times discriminated against specific racial and ethnic groups. Ironically, the most important constitutional law doctrines governing U.S. immigration law solidified during those eras. The modern constitutional doctrine of ""plenary power"" is introduced here. Myths and Realities of an ""Open Border"" Past The Chinese Exclusion Acts and the U.S. Supreme Court The ""Plenary Power"" Doctrine in U.S. Constitutional Law Modern Structure: Federal Agencies and Courts The Faces of Immigration Today: Numbers Week 3: Eligibility for Immigration, Part I This week we will consider the requirements for legal immigration to the U.S. These come in the form of general criteria applicable to all who seek to enter (e.g., no criminal history, not likely to become a ""public charge""), as well as specific requirements for an entry visa and the ""green card"" -- permission to remain in the United States indefinitely as a lawful permanent resident. Requirements for Entry:? Introduction to the Grounds of Inadmissibility Inadmissibility Based on Immigration Control Inadmissibility Based on National Security Inadmissibility Based on Criminal Acts Inadmissibility Based on Public Health Inadmissibility on Economic Grounds Procedures to Determine Admissibility Week 4: Eligibility for Immigration, Part II Week four continues our examination of eligibility for non-U.S. citizens to enter or remain in the country. This week focuses more closely on categories of immigrants -- guest workers, business employees, and family members, as well as temporary visitors such as students and tourists. Along with border security, these visa categories are at the center of current debates over immigration reform, given that the waiting time for some persons eligible to immigrate to the United States can reach decades. Recent proposals for immigration reform are noted here. The ""Green Card"" and a Broken Immigration System Permanent Residency through Family Relationship Citizenship through Marriage and the Marriage Fraud Act Immigration through Employment Refugees and Asylum U.S. Immigration Reform Week 5: Breaking the Rules: Deportation Proceedings and Border Security Our concluding week focuses upon the various grounds for deportation, deportation proceedings, and a brief overview of the U.S. immigration court system. Border security measures seek to protect the nation's security as well as public health and safety. Of particular interest is the ""extended border control"" capability of the Department of Homeland Security. Enhanced border security is one key to political compromise on immigration reform, providing a final opportunity in this course to consider the future direction of immigration law in the United States.",/enroll?course_id=190,190
Nutrition for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention,Coursera,Nutrition & Wellness,NA,"University of California, San Francisco",4.125,8,English,NA,5,2013-06-03,NA,NA,NA,"This course covers the basics of normal nutrition for optimal health outcomes and evidence-based diets for a variety of diseases. Participants will learn the fundamentals of nutrition science and build upon these to explore emerging diet therapies, to analyze nutrition research and to plan well-balanced meals and dietary interventions for both healthy individuals and those with a number of diseases and health conditions.? Syllabus Module 1: ? ? ? ? Introduction to Nutrition Science ? If you are what you eat, you should probably know something about how to eat! In this introductory module, you will learn about the field of nutrition science, the basics of nutrition research and some important terms that will set the stage for the remainder of the class. This module ends with a global look at meal planning guides and tools and provides you with an opportunity to determine your own individual nutrient needs. ? Module 2: ? ? ? ? Heart Disease ? Heart disease is the number one cause of death around the world. Your food choices make a difference when it comes to heart disease. This module we cover the risk factors for heart disease and explore different dietary avenues for the prevention and management of heart disease, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension and stroke. Dietary foci include vegetarian diets, the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet. ? Module 3: ? ? ? ? Diabetes ? Globally, it is estimated that 438 million people ? or roughly 8% of the world¡¯s population ? will have diabetes by 2030. This module looks at the role of nutrition in the prevention and management of pre-diabetes and Types 1, 2 and gestational diabetes. Additional topics include evidence-based recommendations for physical activity with diabetes, meal planning, carbohydrate counting and the roles of dietary fiber and the glycemic index in blood sugar control. ? Module 4: ? ? ? ? Cancer ? Diet and cancer are certainly linked; but the degree to which food intake impacts the development and progression of cancer is still not entirely understood. We will look at the diet-related risk factors in cancer development as well as evidence-based guidelines for the nutritional management of cancer and treatment-related side effects. Additional emphasis is placed on emerging cancer nutrition research and debunking diet and cancer myths. ? Module 5: ? ? ? ? Obesity and Weight Management ? Global statistics for obesity did not exist 50 years ago. Now, you can¡¯t turn around without exploding obesity statistics smacking you in the face! We will explore the complex and interrelated factors that contribute to rising obesity rates, discuss various approaches to weight loss and weight maintenance and strategize for future solutions to this global epidemic. ? Module 6: ? ? ? ? Disorders of the GI Tract ? A healthy digestive tract is crucial for optimal nutrition status. Impairments in any segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can quickly undermine proper nutrient digestion, absorption and utilization. In this module we will look at how a healthy gut should work, and what to do when the digestive process is disrupted. Specific GI focus areas include celiac disease and gluten free foods, diverticular disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, dysphagia, gas, constipation and malabsorptive disorders and look at the roles of dietary fiber and probiotics and prebiotics in gut health.",/enroll?course_id=69,69

Practical Ethics,Coursera,Philosophy,NA,Princeton University,5,2,English,NA,6,2014-03-03,NA,NA,NA,"In this course you will be encouraged to think about some of the ethical issues that we all face in our daily lives, and as concerned, global citizens. The course will focus on the following topics: Brain death and persistent vegetative state When is a person dead? In many countries death is now defined as ¡°brain death,¡± but is this way of understanding death justified? How we define death is important, because it is connected to critical questions such as: When is organ donation permissible? When is it right to take someone off life support? And how should we treat individuals who are in a persistent vegetative state? Abortion and the moral status of embryos and fetus Most people would argue that it is always wrong to intentionally take the life of an innocent human being. This belief is often expressed in terms of support for the ¡°sanctity of human life.¡± Is abortion or embryo research compatible with this idea? Does an embryo have a right to life from the beginning of conception, or is this right something it acquires gradually? When, if ever, is abortion justified? Making end of life decisions How do you distinguish wrongful killing from acts that are not regarded as wrong? Can it ever be right to end the life of someone who cannot express a view about whether he or she wants to live or die? How should we make life and death decisions for severely ill infants? And can euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide be justified? Effective altruism We all spend money on items that are not necessities. In other parts of the world, people die for the want of food or medicines that cost a few cents. The common view is that giving to poor people in other countries is charity, something that is good to do, but not wrong if we don¡¯t. But is that really true? This topic concerns what our responsibility is for people less well of than us, what the best cause is, and what good career choices are. How much we ought to do for others? Climate change On what principles should nations agree on the extent of their emissions of greenhouse gasses? Should the nations that have contributed most to climate change compensate the nations that are suffering, and will suffer, most from it? Or should some other principle of justice govern the way we allocate quotas for greenhouse gas emissions? Animals It is common to draw a sharp line between how we are allowed to treat human beings and what we are allowed to do to animals. We consider cannibalism abhorrent, but routinely raise and kill animals for food. We set strict guidelines for experimenting on human beings, but much more lax ones for experimenting on animals. Is this attitude to animals justifiable? One way to put this question is to ask: ¡°Do animals have rights?¡± But the debate does not have to revolve around animal rights. It can also be put in terms of the idea of equality, and where it stops?that is, does equality only apply to human beings? This topic concerns how we should treat animals, and when experimentation on animals is justified. Environmental values It is one thing to argue that we can extend ethics beyond the boundary of our own species, to other sentient beings, but it is a quite different thing to hold that there is also intrinsic value in something that cannot feel anything, like plants, or isn¡¯t even alive, like mountains and streams. Can such a claim be justified? If it cannot, what difference does it make to the case for wilderness protection? Why act ethically? Many of you might reach the conclusion that the ethical life can be a demanding one. So why bother? Why act ethically, rather than doing whatever you please? This is an ancient question, which some philosophers have dismissed as illegitimate, and others have sought to answer, in various ways. It leads us to questions about the meaning of life, and what it is to lead a good life. This course will introduce you to some of the ways philosophers have approached these questions, as well as some of their answers. You will also be encouraged to question your own ethical beliefs, and in the process explore the extent to which reason and argument can play a role in everyday ethical decision-making.

A Look at Nuclear Science and Technology,Coursera,Physics,NA,University of Pittsburgh,5,3,English,NA,6,2014-03-10,NA,NA,NA,"The course, ¡°A Look at Nuclear Science and Technology¡± is aimed at scientifically inclined individuals who want to learn more about nuclear energy and the nuclear power industry. It will address subjects such as: What is nuclear energy? What is its history? Who are its heroes? Why is it controversial? How do nuclear power plants work? What about nuclear weapons? What are the stereotypes and misconceptions? We expect many students who finish this class to want to go on for further study in a closely related field. Syllabus ¡°A Look at Nuclear Science and Technology¡± is an overview course that provides broad subject-area coverage to introduce students to application of theory to practical aspects of nuclear science and technology in the world today with special emphasis on commercial nuclear power. The course will begin with a general overview of nuclear physics and the practical applications covered by the field of nuclear engineering. The majority of the course will focus on the theory, design and operation of commercial nuclear power reactors. The course will also touch on contemporary issues regarding nuclear power generation including: the nuclear fuel cycle, the economics of nuclear power, and nuclear non-proliferation. The course will begin with a grand tour of the commercial nuclear fuel cycle and power reactors so the student will have some perspective before delving into the theory that is important to understanding the unique aspects of nuclear energy. The course then will return to the fundamentals of basic nuclear physics, reactor physics, energy removal and power conversion to prepare students for in-depth looks at the theory and function of commercial nuclear power reactors. This course is intended for students who have had little to no academic instruction in nuclear engineering. Some of my incentives to teach this class are (1) to stimulate interest and excitement about nuclear science and technology, and (2) to create a more informed citizenry on the subject of nuclear energy utilization in the future.

Compilers,Coursera,Computer Science,NA,Stanford University,4.714285714,7,English,NA,9,2013-02-18,11,NA,NA,"This course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems. As a result, you will learn how a program written in a high-level language designed for humans is systematically translated into a program written in low-level assembly more suited to machines. Along the way we will also touch on how programming languages are designed, programming language semantics, and why there are so many different kinds of programming languages. The course lectures will be presented in short videos. To help you master the material, there will be in-lecture questions to answer, quizzes, and two exams: a midterm and a final. There will also be homework in the form of exercises that ask you to show a sequence of logical steps needed to derive a specific result, such as the sequence of steps a type checker would perform to type check a piece of code, or the sequence of steps a parser would perform to parse an input string. This checking technology is the result of ongoing research at Stanford into developing innovative tools for education, and we're excited to be the first course ever to make it available to students. An optional course project is to write a complete compiler for COOL, the Classroom Object Oriented Language. COOL has the essential features of a realistic programming language, but is small and simple enough that it can be implemented in a few thousand lines of code. Students who choose to do the project can implement it in either C++ or Java. I hope you enjoy the course! Why Study Compilers? Everything that computers do is the result of some program, and all of the millions of programs in the world are written in one of the many thousands of programming languages that have been developed over the last 60 years. Designing and implementing a programming language turns out to be difficult; some of the best minds in computer science have thought about the problems involved and contributed beautiful and deep results. Learning something about compilers will show you the interplay of theory and practice in computer science, especially how powerful general ideas combined with engineering insight can lead to practical solutions to very hard problems. Knowing how a compiler works will also make you a better programmer and increase your ability to learn new programming languages quickly.",/enroll?course_id=22,22

Core Concepts in Data Analysis,Coursera,Data Analysis,NA,Higher School of Economics,3.25,8,English,NA,7,2014-04-30,NA,NA,NA,"The course was created with the support of Sberbank This is an unconventional course in modern Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data Mining. Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis should help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented by the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this view, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and augmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations. The term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and means and more complex summaries: the principal components of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities. Similarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between input and target features including Bayes classifiers. The view of the data as a subject of computational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently. Typically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the investigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a solution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with the advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data set - what sense can be made out of it? ? Is there any structure in the data set? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a traveler¡¯s view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientist sits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodate them into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come on their way ? here is the data analysis niche.? A textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published by Springer-London in 2011: ¡°Core concepts in data analysis is clean and devoid of any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarity seldom seen in a text of this sophistication. ¡¦ To single out just one of the text¡¯s many successes: I doubt readers will ever encounter again such a detailed and excellent treatment of correlation concepts.

Because in most cases the core cause of obesity and its related health conditions is a poor quality of diet and lack of sufficient physical activity, it is no surprise that to reverse this health problem a foundation of proper nutrition and sufficient physical activity is imperative. This course is designed to provide a foundation of nutritional knowledge to develop a sustainable pattern of healthy eating. To this will be added a foundation of knowledge related to physical activity and exercise. These two key lifestyle behaviors are then brought together under the umbrella of calorie balance, which is the understanding of how we balance the calories that we eat in our diet with the calories that we burn to sustain life and to perform all of our daily tasks and functions. Ultimately, this information can only be of value if individuals understand how to engage in these healthy behaviors within their daily lives when they are faced with challenges and barriers. This course will address key issues and will provide information on effective strategies for adopting and maintaining these targeted behaviors as they apply to the adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. Syllabus There are no required textbooks for this course. Please see the list of recommended readings and references below.

The Hardware/Software Interface,Coursera,Software Development,NA,University of Washington,4.5,10,English,NA,12.5,2013-05-01,8,NA,NA,"This course examines key computational abstraction levels below modern high-level languages; number representation, assembly language, introduction to C, memory management, the operating-system process model, high-level machine architecture including the memory hierarchy, and how high-level languages are implemented. We will develop students¡¯ sense of ¡°what really happens¡± when software runs ? and that this question can be answered at several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level, the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level. The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor and the memory hierarchy), and the role of the operating system (but not how the operating system is implemented). Syllabus This course should develop students¡¯ sense of ¡°what really happens¡± when software runs ? and convey that this question can be answered at several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level, the assembly level, the C programming level and the Java programming level. The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor), and the role of the operating system (but not how the operating system is implemented). For (computer science) students wanting to specialize at higher levels of abstraction, this could in the extreme be the only course they take that considers the ¡°C level¡± and below. However, most will take a subset of Systems Programming, Hardware Design and Implementation, Operating Systems, Compilers, etc. For students interested in hardware, embedded systems, computer engineering, computer architecture, etc., this course is the introductory course after which other courses will delve both deeper (into specific topics) and lower (into hardware implementation, circuit design, etc.). The course has three principal themes: Representation: how different data types (from simple integers to arrays of data structures) are represented in memory, how instructions are encoded, and how memory addresses (pointers) are generated and used to create complex structures. Translation: how high-level languages are translated into the basic instructions embodied in process hardware with a particular focus on C and Java. Control flow: how computers organize the order of their computations, keep track of where they are in large programs, and provide the illusion of multiple processes executing in parallel. At the end of this course, students should: understand the multi-step process by which a high-level program becomes a stream of instructions executed by a processor; know what a pointer is and how to use it in manipulating complex data structures; be facile enough with assembly programming (X86) to write simple pieces of code and understand how it maps to high-level languages (and vice-versa); understand the basic organization and parameters of memory hierarchy and its importance for system performance; be able to explain the role of an operating system; know how Java fundamentally differs from C; grasp what parallelism is and why it is important at the system level; and be more effective programmers (more efficient at finding bugs, improved intuition about system performance).

Many interesting philosophical and mathematical issues arise when we carefully examine our group decision-making processes.? There are two types of group decision making problems that we will discuss in this course. A voting problem: Suppose that a group of friends are deciding where to go for dinner. If everyone agrees on which restaurant is best, then it is obvious where to go. But, how should the friends decide where to go if they have different opinions about which restaurant is best?

Comic Books and Graphic Novels,Coursera,Visual Arts,NA,University of Colorado Boulder,0,0,English,NA,3.5,2013-05-20,NA,NA,NA,"The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species of pulp fiction on the margins of children¡¯s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing number of university classrooms and bookstore shelves. ¡°Comic Books and Graphic Novels¡± presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and participate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explores this transformative literary world by arguing that comics have much to teach us about ourselves.

From GPS and Google Maps to Spatial Computing,Coursera,Civil & Environmental Engineering,NA,University of Minnesota,4.5,2,English,NA,7,2014-09-24,NA,NA,NA,"From Google Maps to consumer global positioning system (GPS) devices, spatial technology shapes many lives in both ordinary and extraordinary ways. Thanks to spatial computing, a hiker in Yellowstone and a taxi driver in Manhattan can know precisely where they are, discover nearby points of interest and learn how to reach their destinations. Spatial computing technology is what powers the Foursquare check-in, the maps app on your smartphone, the devices used by scientists to track endangered species, the routing directions that help you get from point A to point B, the precision agriculture technology that is revolutionizing farming, and the augmented reality devices like Google Glass that may soon mediate our interaction with the real world. This course introduces the fundamental ideas underlying spatial computing services, systems, and sciences. Topics covered will include the nature of geospatial information, proper statistical frameworks for working with geospatial data, key algorithms and data structures, spatial data mining, and cartography/geovisualization. We will also address applied topics such as where to find spatial data, how to use powerful open source software to analyze and map spatial data, and frameworks for building location-based services. Three Ways to Enjoy this Course: This course is designed to support three different types of students and educational goals: Curiosity Track: Most of us interact with spatial technologies every day. This track is for students who wish to learn about one or two spatial computing topics, but not commit to an entire course. Curiosity track students are not interested in a certificate of accomplishment. Concepts Track: This track is for students who want to learn about spatial computing concepts in order to make informed choices, but who are not programmers and do not have extensive experience with statistical methods. For example, concepts track students will learn about Tobler¡¯s First Law of geography and map projections, but will not delve into the quantifications of either. Students who complete the concepts track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Statement of Accomplishment. Technical Track: This track builds on the concepts track, but adds math and programming. For example, we will cover spatial statistical indicators like Moran¡¯s I and Ripley¡¯s K when discussing Tobler¡¯s First Law and will have students calculate the distance between two points using two different coordinate systems and open-source APIs. Students who complete the technical track with sufficiently high scores will receive a Distinguished Statement of Accomplishment.

Practicing Tolerance in a Religious Society: The Church and the Jews in Italy,Coursera,Anthropology,NA,"University of Maryland, College Park",3.5,2,English,NA,6,2014-10-06,NA,NA,NA,"Discussions of the centuries-long relationship between Christianity and the Jews are almost always framed in terms of persecution and discrimination with only occasional examples of toleration and kindness. To explain or to excuse the ongoing hatred towards Jews, historians mix together terminologies and concepts drawn from religious theology, psychology, social theory and politics. The catch-all term ""anti-Semitism"" lumps together outbreaks of prejudice and victimization in different times and places. In this course, we shall ask a different question. Our focus is not on why a majority society saw Jews as different or reacted with violence to Jews' ""otherness."" Rather, we ask how in a society dedicated to religious uniformity one group of people was tolerated even though it refused to join the dominant faith. Many modern writers assume that Christianity, and perhaps religion itself, is inherently intolerant of non-believers. But we will see that neither religious nor secular world views necessarily lead to toleration or discrimination. The patterns of Christian-Jewish relations are both complex and intriguing. Our question then is how did a religious society manage to practice tolerance, and under what circumstances did that practice break down? We will focus on the history of Jews in Italy and especially Rome, the city that housed the the longest continuous Jewish settlement in world history and that was also, for most of the past two millennia, the home of the Catholic Church.

By this definition our Earth is very much alive, with many eruptions each year and with a far greater number of ¡°active volcanoes¡± that can potentially erupt in any given year.? In detail, each eruption is different. Every volcano is its own physical and chemical system, occurs in its own geological location, is subjected to its local stress field, and is at its own stage in evolution in geological time.? External triggers of volcanic eruptions are also believed to play an important role. Yet powerful generalisations and models of volcanic eruptions are indeed possible and in fact very useful in dealing with the consequences of volcanic eruptions. How are such models constructed? They must rest on a basis of a mechanistic understanding of what volcanoes are, and what they are doing ? not just during eruptions but also in the events leading up to eruptions, and not just at the Earth¢¥s surface but also at depth, where the magma is being prepared for the next eruption. In addition to field observations of past eruptions, monitoring of signals from magmatic systems, and computer-based simulation of volcanic eruptions, increasingly, high pressure and high temperature experiments are employed in order to answer the question of how volcanic systems work. These controlled laboratory conditions for experimental volcanology are transforming the study of volcanoes from a chiefly observational discipline where eruptive mechanisms were developed via theoretical analysis of such observations, into a fully modern scientific discipline where such theoretical approaches are either verified or rejected, by the experimental picture of what is possible and what is not. This course shows you how such experimental insight is?obtained and what it tells us about erupting volcanoes.

We have no immediate threat emanating from a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students of international relations. This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that have been argued in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given in the course by developing your own analytical capacity. Syllabus The course is divided into four parts: Week 1: ""When is War Necessary?"", raises the question of military intervention in light of theories of just war. Week 2: ""Power Transition and War"", discusses the argument that global transitions in power distribution lead to hegemonic wars. Week 3: ""Democratic Peace, Democratic Wars"", is a reappraisal of the democratic peace theory, and asks if democratization by force provides international security. Week 4: ""Conditions for Peace"", is directed toward?our new assessment of paths toward durable peace.",/enroll?course_id=419,419

It was always part of a global economy, tied into networks of capital, labor, and commodity markets that spanned continents. The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the political and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental empire in the nineteenth century, but ultimately that system had to be destroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power. Why that was ? why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s ? is a matter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the course. The history of the South is a crucial part of the story of the rise of the U.S. as a global power and it is particularly compelling because of its history as a slaveholding society, the wealthiest in the western world in 1860. This course is about the ethical and political questions that history necessarily poses about the relationship between slavery, capitalism, and democracy in U.S. and world history. ?It?is about the rise and fall of the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of the American Civil War.

The material also provides brief, not-too-geeky technical explanations of some common surveillance methods. Syllabus I. Introduction We will begin with a brief overview of how surveillance fits into the American legal system. We will also discuss how surveillance issues can be litigated. II. The Basics of Surveillance Law Next, we will review established police surveillance procedures. Using telephone technology as a simple starting point, we will work through various sorts of data that investigators might seek to access?and the constitutional and statutory safeguards on that data. III. Applying Surveillance Law to Information Technology Having learned the basics, we will turn to more modern technologies.

On Strategy: What Managers can learn from Philosophy - Part 2,Coursera,Management & Leadership,NA,?cole Centrale Paris,4.666666667,3,English,NA,2.5,2013-05-01,3,NA,NA,"This entire MOOC is based on one of my strongest beliefs: philosophy is the best tool to help managers in areas where no numbers are available. After all a strategic vision is an ""idea"", it is translated into a ""concept"", a business model is a ¡¦ ""model"" etc. And we need to better understand what is an idea, what is a concept, what is a model etc. In other words we need to better understand how do we think. In the first six lectures we made a surprising journey from the ancient Greek philosophers to the corporate world of today. You probably crossed a set of ""new territories"" but honestly, it was the same for me ! Apparently this experience has no end in sight! The first six lectures are broadcasted for a second time during this fall and I had the chance to record three additional lectures last September. Not a surprise: philosophy is like a country you want to visit, there are always new roads to discover and even new paths to create. It is highly recommended to have attended lectures 1-6 to take the most out of this part 2. In lecture 7, I examine the deep nature of the changes the world is currently facing and the associated challenges for us. Lecture 8 focus on one of them: the impact of technology on the way we think. In the last lecture I suggest some tips that might help you to become a better manager, in other words to become a corporate philosopher. Evaluations will be similar to the ones you had so far: open questions that request some research. At the end of lecture 9, I will again ask you to submit a short paper about a famous quote of a great philosopher. Moreover, we will organize a Google Hangout during lecture 8.

High Performance Scientific Computing,Coursera,Data Science,NA,University of Washington,5,1,English,NA,7.5,2015-02-23,10,NA,NA,"Computation and simulation are increasingly important in all aspects of science and engineering. At the same time writing efficient computer programs to take full advantage of current computers is becoming increasingly difficult. Even laptops now have 4 or more processors, but using them all to solve a single problem faster often requires rethinking the algorithm to introduce parallelism, and then programming in a language that can express this parallelism.? Writing efficient programs also requires some knowledge of machine arithmetic, computer architecture, and memory hierarchies. Although parallel computing will be covered, this is not a class on the most advanced techniques for using supercomputers, which these days have tens of thousands of processors and cost millions of dollars. Instead, the goal is to teach tools that you can use immediately on your own laptop, desktop, or a small cluster. Cloud computing will also be discussed, and students who don't have a multiprocessor computer of their own will still be able to do projects using Amazon Web Services at very low cost. Along the way there will also be discussion of software engineering tools such as debuggers, unit testing, Makefiles, and the use of version control systems. After all, your time is more valuable than computer time, and a program that runs fast is totally useless if it produces the wrong results. High performance programming is also an important aspect of high performance scientific computing, and so another main theme of the course is the use of basic tools and techniques to improve your efficiency as a computational scientist. Syllabus The use of a variety of languages and techniques will be integrated throughout the course as much as possible, rather than taught linearly. The topics below will be covered at an introductory level, with the goal of learning enough to feel comfortable starting to use them in your everyday work. Once you've reached that level, abundant resources are available on the web to learn the more advanced features that are most relevant for you. Working at the command line in Unix-like shells (e.g. Linux or a Mac OSX terminal). Version control systems, particularly git, and the use of Github and Bitbucket repositories. Work habits for documentation of your code and reproducibility of your results. Interactive Python using IPython, and the IPython Notebook. Python scripting and its uses in scientific computing. Subtleties of computer arithmetic that can affect program correctness. How numbers are stored: binary vs. ASCII representations, efficient I/O. Fortran 90, a compiled language that is widely used in scientific computing. Makefiles for building software and checking dependencies. The high cost of data communication.? Registers, cache, main memory, and how this memory hierarchy affects code performance.? OpenMP on top of Fortran for parallel programming of shared memory computers, such as a multicore laptop. ?MPI on top of Fortran for distributed memory parallel programming, such as on a cluster.

More than just a theory, it offers a way of looking at the world that grows richer with experience and practice.? Our course will provide some of that practice and teach you ""tricks of the trade"" (not found in textbooks) that will enable you to solve quantum-mechanical problems yourself and understand the subject at a deeper level. The basic principles of quantum physics are actually quite simple, but they lead to astonishing outcomes. ?Two examples that we will look at from various perspectives are the prediction of the laser by Albert Einstein in 1917 and the prediction of antimatter by Paul Dirac in 1928.? Both of these predictions came from very simple arguments in quantum theory, and led to results that transformed science and society.? Another familiar phenomenon, magnetism, had been known since antiquity, but only with the advent of quantum physics was it understood how magnets worked, to a degree that made possible the discovery in the 1980¡¯s of ultrastrong rare-earth magnets.? However, lasers, antimatter and magnets are areas of vibrant research, and they are all encountered in the new field of ultracold atomic physics that will provide much of the material of ¡°Exploring Quantum Physics¡±.

What Feynman was referring to are some of the ¡°spooky¡± phenomena like quantum entanglement, which are incomprehensible from the standpoint of classical physics. Even though they have been thoroughly tested by experiment, and are even being exploited for applications such as cryptography and logic processing, they still seem so counterintuitive that they give rise to extraordinary ideas such as the many-world theory.

The aim of the second course is to teach the principles of reactive programming. Reactive programming is an emerging discipline which combines concurrency and event-based and asynchronous systems. It is essential for writing any kind of web-service or distributed system and is also at the core of many high-performance concurrent systems. Reactive programming can be seen as a natural extension of higher-order functional programming to concurrent systems that deal with distributed state?by coordinating and orchestrating asynchronous data streams exchanged by actors. In this course you will discover key elements for writing reactive programs in a composable way. You will find out how to apply these building blocks in the construction of message-driven systems that are scalable and resilient.The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, which are also programming projects. Syllabus Week 1: Review of Principles of Functional Programming: substitution model, for-expressions and how they relate to monads. Introduces a new implementation of for-expressions: random value generators. Shows how this can be used in randomized testing and gives an overview of ScalaCheck, a tool which implements this idea. Week 2: Functional programming and mutable state. What makes an object mutable? How this impacts the substitution model. Extended example: Digital circuit simulation. Week 3: Futures. Introduces futures as another monad, with for-expressions as concrete syntax. Shows how futures can be composed to avoid thread blocking. Discusses cross-thread error handling. Week 4: Reactive stream processing. ?Generalizing futures to reactive computations over streams. Stream operators. Week 5: Actors. Introduces the Actor Model, actors as encapsulated units of consistency, asynchronous message passing, discusses different message delivery semantics (at most once, at least once, exactly once) and eventual consistency. Week 6: Supervision. Introduces reification of failure, hierarchical failure handling, the Error Kernel pattern, lifecycle monitoring, discusses transient and persistent state.Week 7: Conversation Patterns. Discusses the management of conversational state between actors and patterns for flow control, routing of messages to pools of actors for resilience or load balancing, acknowledgement of reception to achieve reliable delivery.",/enroll?course_id=3555,3555

Increasingly business graduates are recognized as possessing important skills that can drive social change. This new discipline is often referred to as Social Entrepreneurship (S-ENT). S-ENT describes the discovery and sustainable exploitation of opportunities to create public goods. This is usually done through the generation of disequilibria in market and non-market environments. The S-ENT process can in some cases lead to the creation of social enterprises. These social ventures are hybrid organizations exhibiting characteristics of both the for-profit and not-for-profit sector. Individuals engaging in S-ENT are usually referred to as social entrepreneurs, a term that describes resourceful individuals working to create social innovation. They do not only have to identify (or create) opportunities for social change (that so far have been unexploited), they must also muster the resources necessary to turn these opportunities into reality. A typical example is Prof. Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh) and recipient of the Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his contribution to poverty alleviation through the invention and popularization of Microfinance. Other examples include fair trade or car-sharing. Today many foundations aim to identify and promote social entrepreneurs. Two prominent examples are Ashoka and the Skoll Foundation. So called venture philanthropists adopt methods from the domain of venture capital, for example, encouraging social entrepreneurs to provide detailed business plans and to measure and report systematically on their social performance. Social Return on Investment (S-ROI) analysis is an example, of an emerging tool aiming to describe the social impact of S-ENT in dollar terms, relative to the philanthropic investment made. As part of the course you will be working in groups on identifying an opportunity for a social innovation or social enterprise. You will then write a business plan outlining the business model for implementing your idea. All business plans will be evaluated at the end of the course and the winners will be supported in the implementation of their idea.

Shakespeare in Community,Coursera,Literature,NA,University of Wisconsin?Madison,4,4,English,NA,6,2013-07-29,4,NA,NA,"Shakespeare in Community?begins as a Massive Open Online Course but it is also a massive public digital humanities event. The course will introduce a broad audience of learners to Shakespeare, as we collectively read, watch, and engage four Shakespeare plays: Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night¡¯s Dream,?Much Ado About Nothing,?and The Tempest. Shakespeare¡¯s Hamlet begins with the curious and provocative line, ¡°Who¡¯s there?,¡± and these are the words that will begin our course. The line is both a literal question to the audience and a deeper question about what it means to be human. The question takes on a different set of potential meanings when it is read on the screen of a computer, iPad, smart phone, or within a MOOC, asking contemporary readers of Shakespeare to consider how their humanity is changing in the face of rapid technological changes. The goal of this?Shakespeare in Community?course,?then, will be to discover Shakespeare while also considering together what it is for us to discover and un-cover Shakespeare in the digital age. Ultimately, this course will be focused on building a global community around the study of Shakespeare. And so one of our central goals will be to use Shakespeare¡¯s plays as an occasion for creating important conversations that bridge cultures, languages, and geographies. Students in the course will also increase their digital literacies, learning new tools for reading, writing, critical analysis, and collaboration. The course will be both about Shakespeare and also about the digital humanities, encouraging learners to think critically about how digital tools (including MOOCs) can be used to investigate literary texts. While the primary instructors have 60+ years of experience teaching Shakespeare among us, we will not be serving as talking head ¡°experts¡± in this course. Rather, the course will bring together a broad range of experts at UW-Madison, within the Madison theater communities, from the Folger Shakespeare Library, and around the world. Launching each week of the course will be a series of short documentaries, but the heart of the course will be the community we build among the participants. Our goal is not to teach you what we know about Shakespeare, but to help each of you find your Shakespeare. Some stuff you can do right now to get started:? Follow @hackshakespeare on Twitter.? Join our?Facebook group.? Watch the second preview. And browse the YouTube Playlist with all the videos produced for the MOOC.Finally, the instructors will be gathering together with some participants from the course and also some new friends for an educational travel experience in Spring Green, WI in September of 2015.

How the film-making business crafted tales that were simultaneously an ""I do!"" of happiness and an ""I don't!"" of disappointment is a fascinating reflection of America's history, changing social attitudes, shifting morals and gender roles. Hollywood found ways both to reflect reality and deflect misery as decade after decade, movies adjusted a basic formula to audience needs.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): How can PPPs help deliver better services?,Coursera,Business,NA,The World Bank,4,1,English,NA,3,2015-03-31,4,NA,NA,"This course provides an understanding of the key principles of PPPs and the role of PPPs in the delivery of infrastructure services, particularly in emerging markets. Participants will learn from practitioners, government officials, and academics with field experience, hearing firsthand about the opportunities and challenges of procuring and maintaining infrastructure services through effective PPPs. The course includes video lectures, readings, quizzes and other learning materials designed and taught by experts from Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, the Indian School of Business, the European Investment Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), among other institutions. Whether you are a member of the general public, a practitioner, or a policy maker, there is something in this course for you. Syllabus Overview This overview presents the main topics the course will include: Week 1: Reducing the Infrastructure Service Gap: The Role of PPPs This first module introduces how and why private sector expertise and resources should be considered by governments to assist in addressing the infrastructure gap. In particular, it explains the importance of infrastructure to economic growth, the gap between the demand and existing supply for infrastructure services, and the challenges that governments have in addressing this gap. The module presents the PPP concept, its defining features, and the types of contractual arrangements, which reflect the extent of the private sector¡¯s participation. Not all arrangements between a public and private party are PPPs and explanations of what is not a PPP are also provided. Examples of successful and failed cases of PPPs are introduced to illustrate conditions for PPP success and to underscore the need for sound analysis and need for sustainability, stakeholder engagement and good governance. Week 2: Getting Decision-Making Right: PPP Frameworks and Institutions Whether undertaking PPPs as a series of ad hoc projects or through a coordinated program, PPPs require a change of approach and mind-set to delivering services and infrastructure. What does this mean for government institutions and what approaches are needed to manage this change? This module examines the principles, value and challenges of putting in place a supportive framework to facilitate the execution of PPP projects with the aim of increased infrastructure investment and improved service delivery. While there is no ¡°model¡± legal or organizational framework for PPPs, a clear and well-communicated articulation of the policy rationale for PPPs as well as the organization of laws, processes and institutional responsibilities that define how PPPs will be implemented are common elements that help ensure a positive private sector response. You will be introduced to lessons learned from the execution of PPPs and how these lessons can be incorporated into successful PPP frameworks. In Week 2, an overview of the different stages of the PPP life cycle is also presented and the first stage of the PPP project cycle (project identification and screening) is explained. This overview provides the foundation for the discussions in weeks three and four, which will go into deeper into the procurement and contract management stages of the PPP project cycle. Week 3: Attracting the Right Partner: Procuring PPPs Being able to engage the right private sector partner starts with a well-prepared, commercially sustainable project. This module begins with a discussion about what is needed to demonstrate the ¡°business case¡± to take forward a project as a PPP and the importance of structuring the PPP arrangements to ensure an appropriate risk allocation between the private sector sponsor, the financiers of the project, and the government. A well-designed and implemented transaction process is equally important, to ensure the best deal for government and to interest potential private sector partners who are able to achieve the desired efficiency and other improvements for the public users. ?However, managing a PPP transaction through to contract award is a complex and iterative process. This module walks through the stages of the tender process and explains the challenges in achieving a successful outcome. ?Finally, the module introduces the management of unsolicited proposals which, while outside a competitive tender process, may be a useful source of innovative ideas, but need to be subject to a thorough evaluation to ensure they respond to government needs efficiently. Week 4: Making the Partnership Work: Implementing PPPs When a PPP contract is signed with a private party, the work of the partnership begins, and both private and public parties have to live up to their responsibilities. PPP contracts attempt to identify and plan for the potential events that could occur during the life of the PPP but can rarely imagine all events into the future. Consequently, developing a strong and trustful partnership and a solid contract management approach is important to achieve the long-term objectives of the PPP. This stage spans the life of the PPP agreement beginning when the PPP contract is signed until the partnership ends. This module presents the fundamentals and challenges of contract management, enforcing the PPP contract requirements and, potentially, renegotiating or terminating contracts. Course Tracks Participants can participate in one of two tracks: Track 1: PPP Awareness (2 hours/week). Track 2: Policy and Practice (3-4 hours/week). Participants can move from the PPP Awareness track to the Policy and Practice track at any point during the course. We encourage participants to join the Policy and Practice track to deepen their knowledge of the subject. Track 1 ? PPP Awareness Target Audience This track is suitable for anyone with a general interest in PPPs and desire to increase their understanding about PPPs. The course provides insight into key concepts and issues in developing, procuring and implementing PPPs. Common Objective To understand PPPs and their role in increasing the delivery of quality infrastructure services. Assignments Assignments focus on facilitating an understanding of the mandatory course material that is covered in the video talks and core readings through multiple choice quizzes and one peer-reviewed opinion piece on a key topic about PPPs. Track 2 ? Policy and Practice Target Audience This track is designed for those wishing to gain greater knowledge of PPPs, and to develop networks of practice with counterparts from around the world. While this course only touches the surface of knowledge and experience about PPPs, references and next steps will be offered for those wishing to continue their learning. Common Objective To understand PPPs and their role in increasing the delivery of quality infrastructure services. Assignments In additional to multiple choice quizzes and the Track 1 assignment, this track includes a project where participants identify an infrastructure project that could be developed as a PPP and create a digital artifact that can be used as a proposal to convince the government to undertake the project. The digital artifact should clearly articulate the value of the project to the government (and for its citizens) and demonstrate how the project would have a balanced risk allocation between the government and the private sector.

Interactive Computer Graphics with WebGL,Coursera,Programming,NA,University of New Mexico,4.5,2,English,NA,7,2015-06-29,NA,NA,NA,"OpenGL is the standard application programming interface (API) to graphics systems for both education and industry. Recent advances in hardware and software have focussed application development on the Web and for mobile devices such as smart phones. Over the past year there has been enormous interest in WebGL, the version of OpenGL that runs within Web browsers and even on newer smart phones. Consequently, for the first time both students and practitioners can develop exciting three-dimensional interactive applications that are independent of the particular platform and can be accessed like any other Web application. In this course, we will learn how to create three-dimensional, interactive applications using WebGL that run within the latest web browsers. By the end of the course, every student will have written and tested a complete interactive three-dimensional application. Because WebGL is the JavaScript implementation of OpenGL ES 2.0, all code will be developed in JavaScript. No prior knowledge of JavaScript is required as long as participants can program in C++, C# or Java.

Substantive instruction will be drawn from the likes of the NFL, MLB, English Premier League, Bundesliga, various player unions, India and much more.?? Ultimately, our goal is to equip the student with a framework and tools with which to understand and evaluate the business side of a wide range of competitive sports ventures. Syllabus Module One: Introduction to Professional Sports I Where is the Money???This module will begin with a focus on the reasons why people are drawn to the sports industry and the built-in advantages that that affinity provides. We will continue with a brief look at the history of the sports business and then proceed to review the current sports business landscape from a league perspective.The lecture will also provide an introduction to the key revenue streams for professional sports franchises - gate receipts,??media rights, sponsorships, and many others. We will conclude by reviewing the key expense items. Module Two: Introduction to Professional Sports II In this module we will begin with a look at how professional sports leagues generate revenue. We will then review how professional sports teams determine their business priorities. In addition, we will investigate the many nuances of professional sports leagues. We will also examine the biggest issues facing the professional sports enterprise today. We will discuss leadership and ownership in the sports business industry. In addition, we will focus on the role of commissioners and analyze reasons for ownership as well as integration strategies that have been developed. Module Three: American and Global Sports Leagues This module will focus on the globalization of sports leagues. We will begin by looking at both the popularity and 'states of' the biggest leagues and begin a discussion on how the largest sports leagues, teams and events generate revenue globally. We will examine the structure of sports leagues and teams including a broad overview of the legal and financial structures.??For example, we will study U.S. and European league governance including promotion and relegation. We will analyze the globalization of labor and product markets in the the Big 4 leagues in the U.S. and the English Premier League and Bundesliga, with a deeper look at Manchester United and its broad array of sponsorships. Module Four: Player Salaries, Unions and Sports Agents The largest figures on the expense side of the sports business ledger are player salaries. This lecture focuses on salaries as well as the key proponents of those salary increases. Sports agents and unions are key stakeholders in the sports business industry. Agents source and manage talent while unions use collective bargaining to champion for an organization of the economic system that favors salary increases. We will analyze the impact these stakeholders have had on the industry in different regions in the world and use case examples including lockouts from the past. Students will have the opportunity to compare and contrast unions around the world. Module Five: Sport Matters In this module, we examine the need for diversity, inclusion, respect, and equality in sports, focusing on the need for leadership to embrace and deliver these principles in a real and tangible way within the sports industry. Sport Matters addresses issues such as: What the Donald Sterling drama can teach us about race and the need for inclusion at the ownership level; the lessons learned from the NFL and Ray Rice case; the Washington Redskins name and the economics of change; what the Miami Dolphins matter tells us about respect in the workplace and beyond; compensation and equality in ¡°amateur¡± sports; and race issues in soccer. Prior to this module, students are asked to read Sport Matters: Leadership, Power, and the Quest for Respect.",/enroll?course_id=346,346
Introduction to Acoustics (Part 1),Coursera,Physics,NA,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,0,0,English,NA,4.5,2014-07-15,5,NA,NA,"This course introduces acoustics by using the concept of impedance. It starts with vibrations and waves, demonstrating how vibrations can be envisaged as a kind of wave, mathematically and physically. The essential measures for acoustic waves, such as dB scale, octave scale, acoustic pressure, energy, intensity, will also be explained. These measures are realized by one-dimensional examples, which provide clear and simple physical insights. The course then moves on to explaining waves on a flat surface of discontinuity, demonstrating how propagation characteristics of waves change in space where there is a distributed impedance mismatch.?Subsequent topics are radiation, scattering, and diffraction, which can be explained in a unified way by seeing the changes of waves due to spatially distributed impedance. Lastly, the course covers sound in closed space, which is considered to be a space that is surrounded by spatially distributed impedance, and introduces two spaces: acoustically large and small space. In Part 1, we will handle topics from vibrations and waves to waves on a flat surface of discontinuity. The later?parts will be?covered in Part 2. This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in acoustics, audio engineering, and noise control engineering. Practicing engineers and researchers in audio engineering and noise control, or students in engineering and physics disciplines, who want to gain an understanding of sound and vibration concepts, are also welcome. Syllabus Week 1: Vibration & Waves How are time and space?related? What about the relation between frequency and wavelength? Does the characteristic impedance of medium determine reflection and transmission? Do we well see the waves of a string in terms of driving point impedance? ? Week 2: Acoustics Wave Equation and Its Basic Physical Measures (1D acoustic wave equation, Acoustic Intensity and Energy, Units of Sound) What are?the relations of acoustic pressure, density, and particle velocity? How do they make acoustic wave equation? Is acoustic wave well analogous with one dimension string wave? ? Week 3: Acoustics Wave Equation and Its Basic Physical Measures (Acoustic Intensity and Energy, Solutions of the Wave equation, Demonstration: hearing system) What about the relation between acoustic intensity and energy? How does human hearing system measure sound and its characteristics? Let us experience the change of sound in level and frequency! ? Week 4: Waves on a Flat Surface of Discontinuity (Normal incidence on a Flat Surface, The Mass Law) How mathematically express the boundary conditions at discontinuity? How does impedance at discontinuity determine reflection and transmission? When can we use mass law? ? ?Week 5: Waves on a Flat Surface of Discontinuity (Transmission Loss, Snell¡¯s Law, Transmission and Reflection of an Infinite Plate/Finite Structure) How different is the transmission loss of a flexible partition compared to the mass law? Does the obliqueness of wave play a critical role to determine transmitted and reflected wave? What?are the roles of partition and fluid loading impedance to transmission loss?",/enroll?course_id=19561,19561

Climate Change,Coursera,Environmental Science,NA,University of Melbourne,5,5,English,NA,7,2015-09-01,NA,NA,NA,"What is Climate Change? How should we respond to Climate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responses available to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particular perspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges and opportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe and explain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientist see Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step to understanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts from different disciplines engage with?the issue. The second step is to appreciate how our response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between these different approaches. This course offers you an introduction to different disciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Change affects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizen of your country and as a member of the global community. We have designed the presentations, discussions, activities and assessment tasks in this course to help you understand what Climate Change is and what you ? and we ? should do about it. Syllabus The overall aim of this subject is to provide an introduction to the socio-political, scientific, and economic aspects of the phenomenon known as Climate Change. In doing so it is hoped that the student will emerge with an enhanced ability to analyse claims both about the science itself and the responses that can be made by humanity at present and for the future, based on current scientific data and its predictions over the next decades.? You will emerge with a broad understanding of the science underpinning the claim that human activity has played a role in causing the current rise in global temperature.

The human mind was sent on a journey to visit other planets ? and time after time it returned from there with breathtaking news, disturbing images or philosophical insight. And, of course, with a lot of questions: Why funeral customs on the Moon include cannibalism and orgies? Is it true that the people of Mars do live according to higher moral standards than we do? And where does this weird alien obsession with terrestrial paper actually come from? These are some of the questions we will be addressing within this course. Moreover, we will watch the birth of the alien reader, we will explore the logics of space invasion and the history of space colonies well. We will examine the inventory of extraterrestrial libraries and survey the competing projects of galactic encyclopedias. Next to well-known authors as Kepler, Cyrano de Bergerac, Stapledon or Lem, you will also be introduced to neglected and forgotten texts. Finally, we might even understand how literature itself was transformed by this journey throughout the universe ? and how it finally became a true interstellar medium.

The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from ""Cinderella"" to Alice in Wonderland to Superman; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, from Frankenstein to Avatar, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind, shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art and as insights into ourselves and our world.

Probability,Coursera,Mathematics,NA,University of Pennsylvania,4.25,4,English,NA,4.5,2015-04-06,NA,NA,NA,"The renowned mathematical physicist Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace wrote in his opus on probability in 1812 that ¡°the most important questions of life are, for the most part, really only problems in probability¡±.? His words ring particularly true today in this the century of ¡°big data¡±. This introductory course takes us through the development of a modern, axiomatic theory of probability.? But, unusually for a technical subject, the material is presented in its lush and glorious historical context, the mathematical theory buttressed and made vivid by rich and beautiful applications drawn from the world around us.? The student will see surprises in election-day counting of ballots, a historical wager the sun will rise tomorrow, the folly of gambling, the sad news about lethal genes, the curiously persistent illusion of the hot hand in sports, the unreasonable efficacy of polls and its implications to medical testing, and a host of other beguiling settings.? A curious individual taking this as a stand-alone course will emerge with a nuanced understanding of the chance processes that surround us and an appreciation of the colourful history and traditions of the subject.? And for the student who wishes to study the subject further, this course provides a sound mathematical foundation for courses at the advanced undergraduate or graduate levels.? Syllabus The course is divided into five topical segments which taken together constitute a self-contained introduction to mathematical probability.? Read on for a bird's-eye view of these topics. Topic I: Towards an axiomatic theory of chance We begin with the stirrings of a mathematical theory in the 17th century in the resolution of a historical wager of the Chevalier de M?r? and follow the developments in understanding leading to the modern axiomatic foundations of probability established in the 20th century. Topic II: From side information to conditional probabilities In this segment we shall encounter unanticipated challenges to intuition when presented with side information about a probability experiment and discover the subtle importance of additivity in a tongue-in-cheek exhortation on the survival of our species. Topic III: Independence?the warp and the woof in the fabric of chance The distinctive and rich intuitive content of the theory of probability and its link to observations in physical experiments is provided by the notion of statistical independence.? We follow the progress from multiplication tables to a formal notion of independence, with enticing applications in a casino game, genetics, and sports psychology to whet the appetite. Topic IV: From polls to bombs and queues?enter the binomial and the Poisson We next turn to ruminations on the implausible efficacy of small polls in tracking sentiments of large populations and discover how the hugely important binomial distribution emerges from these considerations.? We then retrace the historical discovery of a curious approximation to the binomial and stumble upon the fascinating Poisson distribution. ?We promptly explore applications ranging from the merely weighty to the diverting and macabre, the distribution of bomb hits in London in World War II being particularly memorable.

Sports and Building Aerodynamics,Coursera,Mechanical Engineering,NA,Eindhoven University of Technology,3,1,English,NA,5,2014-05-12,6,NA,NA,"Can the present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be further improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in athletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This course provides the answer to these questions. It shows that aerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex and that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused by the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same counter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both sports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will help you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes and of modern building design. In 2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a Tour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25 km, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the subsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat the former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic improvements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And, surprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team time trial has not yet been explored. Records in athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and the long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed 2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail winds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be decisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum aerodynamic setting has not yet been explored. New and prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of the world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy systems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions can lead to suboptimal performance. The course starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of fluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary layers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and building aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the aerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and tricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. This knowledge provides the basis for the course parts on building aerodynamics, 100 m sprint aerodynamics and cycling aerodynamics, where some surprising and sometimes spectacular results will be shown.

Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain,Coursera,Anthropology,NA,University of Colorado System,2.571428571,7,English,NA,1.5,2016-01-25,NA,NA,NA,"Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain? Challenging Assumptions Our modern, global world is often presented as an unprecedented era of exceptional religious, political, and cultural enlightenment. Certainly we continue to experience tumultuous events and problematic relations, but many of us believe our world exists along a trajectory of human progress.? This course is about doubt, questioning, and complications. It opens with the proposition that our present-day world is neither exceptional nor special, but rather is the beneficiary and the slave of history. About this Course: The Challenges of Co-Existence Serving as citizen-scholars, students will learn about the positive and negative elements of inter-religious co-existence in Plasencia, Spain, and more importantly, contribute to an international scholarly effort known as the Revealing Cooperation and Conflict Project. Together, we turn to a historical era that stumbled through the challenges of cultural and religious intermixing and co-existence. From the saved memories of Catholic churchmen, Jewish noble and merchant families, as well as medieval lords and knight clans, students will study and contribute to an effort to revive long lost interactive and cooperative networks of people in Plasencia, Spain. And among the most textured, fascinating elements of our investigation is the history of Spain's Jewish community, or the Sepharad. For example, students will evaluate the Spanish anti-Jewish pogroms of 1391 that led to the large scale conversion of Jews to Christianity (forced and voluntary). By documenting such incidents and the interaction of noteworthy families, religious organizations, political networks, and economic partnerships, we will reconstruct the quintessential cultural dynamics that underlay the foundation of the Castilian world and impacted the broader European continent. Within the documents that students transcribe, we will encounter historical persons such as Zanfines Capa, the Jewish chainmail maker, who was a close associate of the Carvajal family of knights. In this specific case, the Catholic Carvajal clan and their compatriots in the cathedral, the Santa Maria clan (formerly the Jewish Ha-Levis), leased church-owned properties to Jewish families (like the chainmail makers) at the expense of their political competitors, the Catholic Estu?iga family (the Counts of Plasencia and Bejar). In this event, competing and overlapping political and religious jurisdictions are revealed as well as vibrant Catholic-Jewish alliances that sought to expel interloping secular lords. In sum, we will evaluate the lives of Jews, Christians, and Muslims, in a vibrant fifteenth century Spanish community on the edge of incredible events ? the consolidation of Spain under Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand, the encounter with the New World, and the defeat of the Islamic Kingdom of Granada Spain and the expulsion of the Jews from Iberia. The Course Work? In this specific course, students will: (1) study the history of medieval Spain and the community of Plasencia, (2) explore the world of medieval manuscripts and texts, (3) learn to read historical documents, and (4) transcribe and evaluate these documents.? The primary source that students will be transcribing in this course is Book Five (1499-1513) of the Capitulary Acts of the Cathedral of Plasencia, which is a census-like accounting document that details the activities and business transactions of the cathedral. Most students will work with the 19th century transcription of the original 15th century text. Students who wish to challenge themselves will be granted the opportunity to work with the original late fourteenth/fifteenth century text.

Introduction to Recommender Systems,Coursera,Artificial Intelligence,NA,University of Minnesota,3.55,20,English,NA,7,2015-09-08,8,NA,NA,"Recommender systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even other people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will prefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The technology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or researcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice. The algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user collaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality reduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach will be hands-on, with six week projects, each of which will involve implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender. In addition to topical lectures, this course includes interviews and guest lectures with experts from both academia and industry. Beginning in February 2015, you will be able to earn a Verified Certificate by verifying your identity via a webcam and a government-issued ID. This option will provide formal recognition of your achievements in the course and includes the University of Minnesota logo. Before then, you can complete a ¡°test run¡± of the exam. You can then re-take the exam after the Verified Certificate becomes available. For information regarding Verified Certificates, see https://courserahelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201212399-Verified-Certificates Syllabus Introduction to Recommender Systems This module introduces recommender systems and the course. It includes a detailed taxonomy of the types of recommender systems, and also includes a detailed tour of Amazon.com¡¯s recommenders. There is an introductory assessment in the final lesson that leads you through exploring recommender systems on their own. Non-Personalized Recommenders This module covers non-personalized recommender systems, including recommendation based on summary statistics and on product-association rules. These recommenders, which are widely used in practice, include overall popularity (how many people like this? what¡¯s the average rating?) and product-to-product recommenders such as ¡°people who bought this item also bought¡± recommenders. There is an assessment at the end of the module that has you compute non-personalized recommendations. Content-Based Recommenders This module covers content-based recommender systems. These systems build a profile of content preferences based on the content attributes associated with items the users has liked or disliked. We¡¯ll discuss common mechanisms for building and maintaining content preference profiles and have an assessment that has you complete hand computations of content profiles and recommendations. User-User Collaborative Filtering This module covers user-user collaborative filtering recommender systems. This classic method matches a user against other users with similar preferences and then combines the preferences of those ¡°nearest neighbor¡± users to form predictions and recommendations. We cover a number of tunings and variations on the algorithm, and have an assessment where you implement your own user-user CF recommender in a spreadsheet. Evaluation This module focuses on metrics and evaluation. It introduces a variety of metric types, individual metrics, experimental techniques, and evaluation goals. In many ways, it is at the heart of the course -- what¡¯s the point in having lots of different algorithms if you can¡¯t tell which is better in a situation? The assessment at the end of this module takes you through a set of situations to test your understanding of effective evaluation. Item Based This module introduces item-item collaborative filtering, an early innovation that improved run-time performance by computing relationships among items from user rating data. We also look at the interesting case of unary implicit data (like it or don¡¯t know) and have an assessment that has you compute item-item recommendations in a spreadsheet. Dimensionality Reduction This module introduces matrix factorization recommendation algorithms, the class of algorithms that seems to be among the most promising today for good recommendation quality and scalability. We introduce you to the concepts behind these algorithms, some specific implementations, and a look at current directions. Your last assessment in the course involves computing predictions and recommendations from factored-matrix representations of ratings matrices. Advanced Topics This is our concluding module; it includes coverage of topics such as security threats and the cold-start problem as well as a number of other practical issues. This module also consists of a three-part final exam, covering modules 6-8.",/enroll?course_id=3336,3336
