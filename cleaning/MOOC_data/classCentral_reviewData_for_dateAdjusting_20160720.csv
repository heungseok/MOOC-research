Hardware Security,9,3,Anonymous,2,2015-04-19,null,The course is too formal and theoretical. It gathers and tries to systematize academic approaches for Hardware Security that are often very far away from the practice. Quizzes are boring and check your ability to remember definitions or making modular arithmetic.
