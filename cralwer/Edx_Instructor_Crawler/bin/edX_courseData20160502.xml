Elliott is an authority on the last four centuries of Chinese history, in particular the Qing period (1636-1911). His research encompasses the history of relations between China and its nomadic frontier, with special attention to questions of ethnicity and empire. His first book, The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China, is a pioneering study in the “New Qing History,” an approach emphasizing the imprint of Inner Asian traditions upon China’s last imperial state. He serves on numerous editorial boards, and was for three years the director of the Fairbank Center of Chinese Studies. A graduate of Yale (BA 1981 summa cum laude, MA 1984), Elliott earned his PhD in History at the University of California, Berkeley. He taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara and at the University of Michigan before coming to Harvard in 2003.

After 23 years at Microsoft in different engineering roles Björn got exposed to MOOCs through an intern in his team. He then set his goal to join the Learning Experience team to be part of the learning revolution. The French revolution was also exciting, but this one has fewer guillotines, which is a pretty big plus in his book.

Björn has worked for most of his career in the area of globalization engineering. If only he had the frequent flier miles to show for it he’d be writing this from Maui. He’s the inventor of the Multilingual User Interface, the Language Interface Packs, and holds five other software patents. He founded the Microsoft World Ready Guides in 2001 and co-authored the 2nd Edition of Developing International Software in 2001 under the assumed name “Dr. International,” which, sadly, the authorities would not print on his passport for some reason they would not fully explain.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/bjorn-rettig</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Nadine Kano</name><job>Partner</job><institution>The Arioso Group, LLC</institution><numberOfCourses>3</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>DIS50.1xDeveloping International Software, Part 1</course><course>DIS50.2Developing International Software, Part 2</course><course>DIS50.3xDeveloping International Software, Part 3</course></Courses><resume>Nadine spent twenty-three years at Microsoft working in a variety of technical and business roles. Straight out of college, she joined the Word for Windows team, eventually signing off on several dozen Western European versions of Word, from Word for Windows 1.0 through Word for Windows 6.0. Although writing code was fun, she found she actually liked teaching better. So she transferred to the Windows team, where she lectured on software internationalization, wrote the landmark book Developing International Software, and a ton of articles for publications like Microsoft Systems Journal, Microsoft Developer Network and Multilingual Computing Magazine.

After graduating from Microsoft in 2012, Nadine co-founded The Arioso Group, LLC, a consulting firm specializing in communications, where she practices the art of helping corporations and startups tell their stories. She’s totally stoked to participate in telling the story of software internationalization, particularly since she gets to tell it in a non-boring way.

Elle est également kinésithérapeute et ostéopathe. Son enseignement  s’articule autour de l’anthropologie du corps et de l’anthropologie de l’espace. Ses premières recherches en anthropologie portent sur les sociétés postsoviétiques d’Asie centrale, en particulier sur la vie quotidienne des nomades kazakhs, les pratiques et les croyances liées au chamanisme sibérien et au soufisme perse. Depuis quelques années, elle déploie une recherche comparative entre l’Asie centrale et le Ladakh, sur les pratiques d’oracles et de guérison. Dans ces deux contextes, la circulation de la belle parole, précisément celle adressée aux invisibles, se trouve au centre de son questionnement. C’est à partir de la circulation de la parole (gestuelle et verbale) qu’elle a entamé récemment une autre recherche au Cap Vert, auprès d’une compagnie de danse contemporaine.
 
Anne-Marie Vuillemenot is professor at the University of Louvain and director of Laboratory for a prospective Anthropology (LAAP). She is also a physiotherapist and osteopath. Her teaching focuses on bodily anthropology and anthropology of space. Her early research focuses on the post-Soviet societies of Central Asia, especially in the daily life of Kazakh nomads, practices and beliefs related to Siberian shamanism and Persian Sufism. In recent years, she has been deploying  a comparative study between Central Asia and Ladakh, the oracles and healing practices. In both contexts, the circulation of the beautiful Word, specifically the one addressed to the Invisible, is at the center of her questioning. From this circulation of Word (gestures and words) she recently began another research in Cape Verde, within a contemporary dance company.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/anne-marie-vuillemenot</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Dr. Chris Caplice</name><job>Silver Family Research FellowExecutive Director, MIT Center for Transportation &amp; Logistics (CTL)Director, MITx MicroMaster's Program in Supply Chain Management</job><institution>MIT</institution><numberOfCourses>5</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>CTL.SC0xSupply Chain Analytics</course><course>CTL.SC2xSupply Chain Design</course><course>CTL.SC3xSupply Chain Dynamics</course><course>CTL.SC1xSupply Chain Fundamentals</course><course>CTL.SC4xSupply Chain Technology &amp; Systems</course></Courses><resume/><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/dr-chris-caplice</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Мартин Шиндлер</name><job>null</job><institution>null</institution><numberOfCourses>1</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>FPP.1xФинансовое программирование и политика, часть 1: макроэкономические счета и анализ</course></Courses><resume>Заместитель директора Объединенного венского института с сентября 2014 года.

She explores how these ideals – or lack of them – shape our governments and us, asking how transparency makes them and us more worthy of holding power. Rebecca’s research is participatory, in that she observes how government agencies respond to calls for transparency, information or engagement; the approach is both sociological and legal. Her research is based on the assumption that all of us are equal and have not simply the right but at times the obligation to question. She has also made submissions to the Negotiators of the forthcoming Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement on the political and legal significance of including public participation within forthcoming trade agreements.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/rebecca-laforgia</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Pan Zeng</name><job>null</job><institution>null</institution><numberOfCourses>2</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>70120073xFinite Element Method (FEM) Analysis and Applications</course><course>70120073xFinite Element Method (FEM) Analysis and Applications</course></Courses><resume>Dr. Pan Zeng is a professor of Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University.

Professors Easley and Kleinberg recently co-authored Networks, Crowds and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. The book is based on the popular undergraduate course, Networks, which they developed at Cornell. It combines different scientific perspectives in its approach to understanding networks and behavior in networked environments. Drawing on ideas from economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics, the book describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of all these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/david-easley</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Jon Kleinberg</name><job>null</job><institution>null</institution><numberOfCourses>1</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>INFO2040xNetworks, Crowds and Markets</course></Courses><resume>Jon Kleinberg is the Tisch University Professor of Computer Science and Information Science at Cornell, where he is currently chair of the Department of Information Science.

He has conducted and published research at molecular, systems, organismal and evolutionary levels of analysis in both animals and humans.

The focus of Dr. Curley’s lab at Columbia is on the development of social behavior. Dr. Curley is interested in how both inherited genetic variability and social experiences during development can shift individual differences in various aspects of social behavior and what the neuroendocrinological basis of these differences may be. He also researches the reliability and validity of social behavioral tests conducted in the laboratory and whether it is possible to utilize alternative statistical and methodological approaches to more appropriately assess social behavior. Dr Curley believes that it is critical to understand how the 'social brains' of humans and other animals have been differentially shaped by evolution and to acknowledge how this should better inform translational research.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/james-curley</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Andrew Gelman</name><job>Professor of Statistics and Political Science</job><institution>Columbia University</institution><numberOfCourses>1</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>DS101XStatistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics</course></Courses><resume>Andrew Gelman is a professor of statistics and political science and director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University.

After 23 years at Microsoft in different engineering roles Björn got exposed to MOOCs through an intern in his team. He then set his goal to join the Learning Experience team to be part of the learning revolution. The French revolution was also exciting, but this one has fewer guillotines, which is a pretty big plus in his book.

Björn has worked for most of his career in the area of globalization engineering. If only he had the frequent flier miles to show for it he’d be writing this from Maui. He’s the inventor of the Multilingual User Interface, the Language Interface Packs, and holds five other software patents. He founded the Microsoft World Ready Guides in 2001 and co-authored the 2nd Edition of Developing International Software in 2001 under the assumed name “Dr. International,” which, sadly, the authorities would not print on his passport for some reason they would not fully explain.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/bjorn-rettig</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Nadine Kano</name><job>Partner</job><institution>The Arioso Group, LLC</institution><numberOfCourses>3</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>DIS50.1xDeveloping International Software, Part 1</course><course>DIS50.2Developing International Software, Part 2</course><course>DIS50.3xDeveloping International Software, Part 3</course></Courses><resume>Nadine spent twenty-three years at Microsoft working in a variety of technical and business roles. Straight out of college, she joined the Word for Windows team, eventually signing off on several dozen Western European versions of Word, from Word for Windows 1.0 through Word for Windows 6.0. Although writing code was fun, she found she actually liked teaching better. So she transferred to the Windows team, where she lectured on software internationalization, wrote the landmark book Developing International Software, and a ton of articles for publications like Microsoft Systems Journal, Microsoft Developer Network and Multilingual Computing Magazine.

After graduating from Microsoft in 2012, Nadine co-founded The Arioso Group, LLC, a consulting firm specializing in communications, where she practices the art of helping corporations and startups tell their stories. She’s totally stoked to participate in telling the story of software internationalization, particularly since she gets to tell it in a non-boring way.

A Princeton graduate with a BSE in Computer Science, Nadine served on the university’s Computer Science Department advisory council for 12 years and augmented her computer science background with an MBA from Stanford University Graduate School of Business. She also has a culinary degree from Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and teaches cooking classes as a hobby. She enjoys making pastries, but tries to avoid eating them.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/nadine-kano</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>August de los Reyes</name><job>null</job><institution>null</institution><numberOfCourses>1</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>DIS50.2Developing International Software, Part 2</course></Courses><resume>August de los Reyes is the Principal Design Director for Xbox at Microsoft, responsible for designing everything but games. In other words, he has a really cool job. He originally joined Microsoft in 2003 and worked on projects that spanned the company, including MSN, Windows, and Surface. Prior to Microsoft, August lived in the Netherlands, where he led interaction design efforts for Philips Design. He also helped lead design for internationalization of Kodak’s Web site in thirty-two countries. August is a member of the Advanced Studies Program at Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he received his MDesS with distinction. He also employs his right brain on the West Coast—he is an affiliate faculty member of the Design Division at the University of Washington. August has lectured around the world at institutions that include MIT, University of Toronto, University of Ljubljana, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and the University of Southern California. With edX, he now gets to lecture to far corners of the world without actually going anywhere.

For the past two years, Nowak has been responsible for producing this GROOC, serving McGill’s Teaching &amp; Learning Services. Prior to this role, she was the founding Integrating Director of the Social Economy Initiative and an advisor to both The Jeanne Sauvé Foundation and The J.W. McConnell Family Foundation.
 
Nowak has two core beliefs when it comes to creating change in the world. First, that empathy is the most positively disruptive force on the planet – but only when it leads to “empathic action,” and second, that social entrepreneurship inspired by empathic action drives sustainable social change. These ideas are embedded in her first book, The Empaths Strike Back (forthcoming), and the course she teaches for the Desautels Faculty of Management, Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship &amp; Social Innovation.

After 23 years at Microsoft in different engineering roles Björn got exposed to MOOCs through an intern in his team. He then set his goal to join the Learning Experience team to be part of the learning revolution. The French revolution was also exciting, but this one has fewer guillotines, which is a pretty big plus in his book.

Björn has worked for most of his career in the area of globalization engineering. If only he had the frequent flier miles to show for it he’d be writing this from Maui. He’s the inventor of the Multilingual User Interface, the Language Interface Packs, and holds five other software patents. He founded the Microsoft World Ready Guides in 2001 and co-authored the 2nd Edition of Developing International Software in 2001 under the assumed name “Dr. International,” which, sadly, the authorities would not print on his passport for some reason they would not fully explain.</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/bjorn-rettig</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Daniel Goldschmidt</name><job>null</job><institution>null</institution><numberOfCourses>1</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>DIS50.1xDeveloping International Software, Part 1</course></Courses><resume>Daniel is leader of the Internationalization Team in C&amp;E at Microsoft.

As a senior software engineer and professional in the globalization of software and content field, he has extensive experience in the internationalization and localization of large-scale enterprise applications and projects.
 
He has previously served as a senior software engineer in the Google Internationalization Team, working on the Google Localization Framework, and he was recently invited by the European Commission to serve as an independent expert in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) program. Now that he’s worked for Google AND Microsoft, he just needs to start driving for Uber to complete a trifecta of geekdom no one has yet achieved. Daniel holds a B.Sc. in computer sciences and mathematics (cum laude) and a M.Sc. in computer sciences, both from the Hebrew University, Jerusalem.

Straight out of college, she joined the Word for Windows team, eventually signing off on several dozen Western European versions of Word, from Word for Windows 1.0 through Word for Windows 6.0. Although writing code was fun, she found she actually liked teaching better. So she transferred to the Windows team, where she lectured on software internationalization, wrote the landmark book Developing International Software, and a ton of articles for publications like Microsoft Systems Journal, Microsoft Developer Network and Multilingual Computing Magazine.

After graduating from Microsoft in 2012, Nadine co-founded The Arioso Group, LLC, a consulting firm specializing in communications, where she practices the art of helping corporations and startups tell their stories. She’s totally stoked to participate in telling the story of software internationalization, particularly since she gets to tell it in a non-boring way.

A Princeton graduate with a BSE in Computer Science, Nadine served on the university’s Computer Science Department advisory council for 12 years and augmented her computer science background with an MBA from Stanford University Graduate School of Business. She also has a culinary degree from Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and teaches cooking classes as a hobby.

Wooster Professor of the Classics at Colgate University, where he has taught since 1986. A British citizen by birth, he obtained his B.A. from Manchester University, his M.A. from McMaster University, and his Ph.D. from University College London.  He is a Fulbright Scholar, a former Junior Fellow at the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington D.C., a Visiting Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and former Benjamin-Meaker Distinguished Professor at Bristol University. As a historian of Greece and Rome,  he has published numerous books, including The Greek Way of Death, The Piraeus, The Greek Way of Life, Introducing New Gods, Religion and the Greeks, The Eye of the Beholder: Deformity and Disability in the Graeco-Roman World, Daily Life of the Ancient Greeks, Celebrity and the Greeks, Julius Caesar, Surviving Greek Tragedy, and Hannibal. His most recent book is Wandering Greeks, published by Princeton University Press (2014), an investigation of refugees and other displaced persons in the Greek world.  He has produced two lecture series for the Great Courses, namely Greece and Rome: An Integrated History of the Ancient Mediterranean and The Other Side of History. He has also appeared on the History Channel. He has a deep interest in the theater and has produced several Greek plays at Colgate. He is committed to the notion that the study of the ancient world is an invaluable resource for understanding the modern world. Neither a presentist nor a historicist, he believes that antiquity and modernity are in constant dialogue with one other. He considers himself privileged to have been able to explore his passion with some remarkable students in an ideal setting at Colgate University, but he is no less committed to the belief that scholars in the Humanities have a duty to reach out to a wider public. It is with that purpose and motivation in mind that he undertook to prepare Greeks at War. </resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/robert-garland</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Liu Jiaying</name><job>null</job><institution>null</institution><numberOfCourses>2</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>04831750.2xFundamental Algorithms | 算法基础</course><course>04831750.1xC++ Programming | C++程序设计</course></Courses><resume>刘家瑛，博士，北京大学计算机科学技术研究所副教授。2010年6月毕业于北京大学计算机应用技术专业，获理学博士学位。2007年至2008年赴美国南加州大学多媒体通讯实验室做访问学者。2010年7月留校任教，加入北京大学计算机科学技术研究所从事科研教学工作。研究领域主要关注于图像视频处理与编码优化，已发表学术论文50余篇，申请发明专利近30项，其中7项已授权。曾获得“北京大学青年教师教学基本功比赛”一等奖，“教学信息化先进个人”。</resume><url>https://www.edx.org/bio/liu-jiaying</url></InstructorInfo><InstructorInfo><name>Guo Wei</name><job>null</job><institution>null</institution><numberOfCourses>2</numberOfCourses><Courses><course>04831750.2xFundamental Algorithms | 算法基础</course><course>04831750.1xC++ Programming | C++程序设计</course></Courses><resume>郭炜，1997年毕业于北京大学计算机系，获硕士学位，留校任教至今，讲授《程序设计实习》等课程。
